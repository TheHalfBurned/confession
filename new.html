          Hello MadamðŸ˜„,
          <br />
          I remember the first time I saw you on the basketball court during my second semester. There was something about youâ€”your energy, your focusâ€”that instantly captured my attention. I didnâ€™t know your name back then, but I felt something stir inside me, something I couldnâ€™t quite explain. We were from different departmentsâ€”you, studying Cyber Security, and me, a Cloud Tech majorâ€”but I couldnâ€™t help but admire you from afar.
By the time my third semester arrived, a small twist of fate brought us a little closer. A coding batch was formed, and when I saw your name on the list, I was overjoyed. The fact that I would be working alongside you made my heart race, but it was also a little nerve-wracking because, despite being in the same group, I didnâ€™t know how to start a conversation.
It was during this time that I slowly began talking to you, making friends with the people you hung out with, and, thanks to my friend Vaibhav, I was finally able to find a way to start a conversation. I remember every moment, every laugh, and every shared look. At first, I was just excited to know you better, but that all changed when we participated in the Smart India Hackathon.
It wasnâ€™t just about the hackathon itself.</p> 
<p>
We faced a lot of tough questions during the presentation, and you stood up for us with such grace and determination. You didnâ€™t back down, even when things seemed difficult. It was then that I realizedâ€”what I had been feeling wasnâ€™t just admiration. I had fallen for you, deeply, in that moment. I fell in love with how you fought for the team, how you took charge when everyone else was uncertain. That strength, that passionâ€”everything about you captured my heart.
Fast forward to mid-October, when my friend Vaibhav, always the prankster, got his hands on my phone. What started as a joke turned into a moment of honesty. I confessed my feelings to you, and although you didnâ€™t feel the same way at the time, you were kind and open to talking to me. Since then, every day has been a journey of getting to know each other better, of building a bond I never imagined would grow this strong.
Youâ€™ve been my pillar of support, Sneha. When I felt low, you lifted me up.</p>
<p>
You motivated me when I thought I had nothing left to give. And when you were going through your own struggles, I did my best to be there for you. Thereâ€™s a quiet strength in our friendship, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you by my side.
I know that right now, your dream is to be an independent woman, and I support that wholeheartedly. But I canâ€™t deny that I picture a future where you and I are together, where we stand side by side as partners, pushing each other to be the best versions of ourselves. You are everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted in a person, and I hope that, one day, you might feel the same way about me.
I call you â€˜Madamâ€™ as a playful joke, but to me, you are so much more than that. You are my inspiration, my friend, and the one who holds my heart.
I donâ€™t know what the future holds, but I do know that no matter what, youâ€™ll always be a part of my journey.
    </p>
        <p>
          With all my heart,</p>
          Siddharth
          </p>
        <p>Miss You A Every Moment ðŸ¤žðŸ’–</p>
